The expeditious application of security patches is paramount for precluding cyber-attacks and sustaining system security. Nevertheless, proficient identification and application of patches hinge on a comprehensive and precise security patch dataset. In this paper, we propose an innovative methodology dubbed Semantic Equivalent Security Patch to facilitate the creation of extensive security patch Datasets(SEPD). SEPD navigates through many code repositories and their branches to identify potential security patches, introducing three inventive patch synthesis methods to augment the richness of patch repair features, compensating for the multiple constraints of current security patch datasets. Through intensive experimental evaluations, we validate the wide-ranging applicability and practicality of SEPD in terms of patch coverage, patch consistency, patch feature distribution, and patch quality. Additionally, our experimental findings illustrate that datasets assembled using SEPD excel in performance in the task of security patch identification compared to existing datasets. Consequently, we posit that introducing SEPD will equip software security research, automated patch generation, and vulnerability prevention with a novel and efficacious instrument.
